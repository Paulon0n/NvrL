- updated README

- updated CHANGELOG

[12.07.13] neuron (Alpha) v.0.015
- started work on cluster U.I..
	- added "Create cluster from selection"
	- added editable options for cluster

[12.02.13] neuron (Alpha) v.0.014
- fixed small bug with editing connection weight

[12.01.13] neuron (Alpha) v.0.014
- Neuron type UI is complete
	- data for each type needs to be entered
- U.I. overhaul is done
	- con's
		- visibly not pretty
	- pro's
		- crazy easy to expand

[11.28.13] neuron (Alpha) v.0.013
- lots of cleanup
	- reorganized U.I. class
		- still need to order U.I. action numbers
		- reordered to menu/sub menu layout
	- removed U.I. handler/thread 
		- not needed with new U.I. structure
- Groups now automatically save on creation/deletion of a group
	- removed menu option to save groups (not needed)
- 'move' neuron sub menu does not change to 'place' as planned
- neuron types still in development.

[11.24.13] neuron (Alpha) v.0.012
- changed bot movement to wrap around screen, seeing as there are no wall 
sensors yet.
- added some code documentation
- BrainStorming an idea for a script neuron type
- [side note] i have to finish neuron type selection before moving on...
	- There are still several things that need to be worked out with neuron
	types
		- UI will be the easiest as when one creates/adds a neuron a popup 
		menu will
			need to be navigated to select the neurons type.
		- Neuron properties will need to include editing the type of neuron
		- Neuron types will need a way to alter the finer attributes of 
		each type's properties
		- I just had a thought that would completely redesign neuron 
		properties
			- instead of a U.I. (including sliders check boxes and such)
have a list of the neurons properties and make them editable appropriately.
this would make the expansion of customization to each neuron much easier.
Right now it might be slower because each edit of a property of a neuron 
would require selecting: neuron icon >>> neuron properties >>> select the
desired property to edit >>> edit it >>> confirm with o.k.
5 steps is on the edge of annoying(could be very, i have yet to use it 
actively), so must be reduced somehow.

[11.22.13] neuron (Alpha) v.0.010

- added 
	- food sense neuron type handling into bot engine.
	- enemy sense neuron type handling into bot engine.
- need to fix bot cloning/copying to include neuron types (bot global 
engine and U.I.).
- need to change group naming convention for placing and deleting a group.

[11.20.13] neuron (Alpha) v.0.009
- adding some game input types into the bot engine
	- heart
	- health
- added game outputs into bot engine
	- turn
		- left
		- right
		- inhibit left
		- inhibit right
		- inhibit turn
	- move
		- forward
		- backward

[11.19.13] neuron (Alpha) v.0.008
- changed U.I. from bugs to bots
- made layer below and above active layer, visible
- changed touched point cursor to x rather then a circle
- changed selection marker to + rather then a circle
- updated read me, needs work.

[11.18.13] neuron (Alpha) v.0.007
- added button to U.I. for type editing
	- still trying to decide the best way to handle type selection as 
	their can be many sub groups.
- internally renamed 'bug' to 'Bot'
	- updated naming conventions(i'm sure i have missed some).
	- U.I. needs updating.
	- updated save to reflect change.

[11.16.13] neuron (Alpha) v.0.006
- added new neuron type system
	- it is now more flexible and expandable

[11.16.13] Brain-storming (notes/comments)
- rename bugs to bots (this just makes sense, and less confusing)
- neuron types are going to make neuron save data variable 
	- Array List should be used to keep track of neuron type data as 
	different types will need/use different amounts of parameters.
- I get very excited when I think of the first release(whenever that 
happens).
	- the thought of threading becomes very clear, because of natural 
	parallelization to neurons.
	- I keep thinking that one well developed cluster can give rise to 
	intelligence.
		- The key is to find good connection growth code. (which might 
		change or have a greater degree of control via options)
	- I am also continuing to grasp the idea of 'neural' as a stand alone 
	programming construct with all the flexibility of java.
		- This will take a great amount of thought
			- mostly as to how neurons will fill parameters to a java 
			command
			- also because of neural parallelization how would numeric 
			variables find there place.
			- I also think the learning curve for this is going to be 
				troublesome for traditional coders, but i have hopes that 
				the trouble of learning will be worth it.
			- basic math is also a concern
				- variables and math can be done as of now but requires a 
				great deal of work
					- comparable to the construction of hardware mechanics
					to handle the operations.
					- I would like to find some way of making it simple.
