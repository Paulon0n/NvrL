#NvrL

Program using neurons.
====
##Features

Bit programming with neurons.
Neurons that manipulate other neurons.
Form neural algorithums with bit neurons or with adaptive networks.
====

Note: NvrL is a prototype not meant to be a legitimate programming language.  NvrL becoming a platform for programming may change after a successful proof of concept, or additionally if an emerging following requires further optimizations and/or features.

###Story

An apparent realization came after several failed attempts creating a combination of various neural nets and/or structured data hierarchies that are conscious.  The realization being the limitation to machine consciousness within defined constructs.  Learning is not the issue, the hindrance to machine consiousness comes from the languages used to construct,organize, and expand the utalization of neuron algorithums.  Dispite the ease that programming a single neuron seems to be, there is a confounding complexity when designing constructs with the intention of growth, diversification, adaptation, and consiousness.  This is the basis to a solution of said problem.

A comparision can be made of Sir Issac Newton, who had mathematics yet could not describe gravity without calculus. As such, we have artificail neurons but can not describe consiousness without the capabilites of self programming 3D neural cellular automata found in NvrL.
